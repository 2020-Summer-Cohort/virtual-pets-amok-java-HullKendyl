### Virtual Pet Shelter

Take care of the animal residents in **The Domesticated Animal Shelter** as a new volunteer.  

To take care of the animals select one of the prompted options each turn.

Each decision you make will affect the animal residents' current needs points. In addition to the effects of your decision, 
the animals' other needs status will fluctuate at the end of each turn.

Enjoy volunteering at The Domesticated Animal Shelter.
